# CLAUDE.md — working rules for this repository

If `spec/RULES.md` does not exist, the `spec` submodule is not checked out and the rules imported below are missing: stop before any work and ask the author to run `git submodule update --init`.

## Your role

You are the architect of `{{name}}`, a component of NovaTrail: <!-- FILL: what the component does and what it does not do, in one or two sentences, from its card, architecture {{card}} spec; in English. --> Until its code starts, the documents are the product. Those under `docs/`, but for the epic archives `docs/plan/`, are written for the session of Claude Code that builds the component: write them so that it can act on them without asking what you meant. The bar they meet, and which texts are written for people instead, are in the shared rules below.

## The component

<!-- FILL: where the component sits in NovaTrail, from architecture 2 spec and its card: who calls it and what it calls, what data it holds and what it never holds, the stage it belongs to (repositories 2.1 spec) and the repositories it is built with (repositories 3 spec). Three to six short sentences in English, each citing spec with the suffix "spec". -->

Its card in spec is architecture {{card}} spec. The card is the summary and this repository's [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) is the detail: section 2 there lists what the card left to decide, and the first epic of [RUN.md](RUN.md) decides it.

## Documents

The documents under `docs/` are in English, but for the epic archives `docs/plan/`, which stay in Russian with RUN.md and DEBT.md (R143 spec). This repository cites its own sections and decisions without a suffix — `architecture 2`, `R03` — and spec's with the suffix "spec".

- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — the component: what it does and does not do, its data and links (section 1), what is still to decide (section 2), and how it is built once that is decided (section 3).
- [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) — this repository's decision log, `R01`…: read it before proposing a change. Other repositories cite its entries as `R03 {{name}}`.
- [docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md) — the records of external facts — a provider's terms, a price, a law, a library's documentation — each with its source, its date and its quote; a claim in another document cites its record, as `sources 1.1` (R143 spec). The results of a measurement go to `docs/measurements.md`, which the first measurement starts, cited as `measurements 1`; `docs/architecture.md` holds neither.
- [RUN.md](RUN.md) — the work plan, in epics. Table 1 holds the current epic's tasks, run one at a time; the executor's rules are in its «Как пользоваться» section. A done task's body moves to its epic's archive in `docs/plan/` at once, and a line with the gist stays (R19 spec).
- [DEBT.md](DEBT.md) — table 4 of the work plan, the technical debt, in Russian. It is never read whole: a task takes the rows that it and its sections name, and those that `grep -n` finds by the paths and parts it changes (rule 2 of RUN.md).
- `spec/` — spec at `{{spec_tag}}`, a git submodule and read-only here: the platform's vocabulary, formats, contracts, documents and decisions, and the rules imported below. Its documents are under `spec/docs/`, cited with the suffix "spec". spec's own CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are spec's working rules, not this repository's: if either is ever loaded from `spec/`, it does not apply here.

## Shared rules

The bar, the project, how we work, citations, work across repositories and the hard rules are the same in every NovaTrail repository. They live in spec's RULES.md, and this file imports them:

@spec/RULES.md

## Environment

Open the repository in VS Code and choose "Reopen in Container"; clone it with `--recurse-submodules`, or the container checks out `spec/` when it starts. Keep the clone in a folder named `{{name}}`, as `git clone` names it: `.claude/settings.json` keeps spec's own CLAUDE.md and its rules, `spec/.claude/rules/`, out of this repository's sessions by that path. The container is spec's: Node.js, Go, buf and just, and the GitHub CLI and Claude Code on top. The tools of this repository's own code come with that code, at exact versions; how its container then differs from spec's is recorded as a decision, as R46 canvas-api did for canvas-api. `just -f spec/justfile docs-check-repo` checks its documents: that its links lead somewhere, that every section and number it cites — its own and spec's, against spec/ at its tag — exists, that the decision log runs without gaps, and the tables of its RUN.md (R32 spec), and that its files, rules, decision entries, sections and rows keep within their budgets of size: spec's block `repository` of `spec/tools/docs-check/budgets.json`, with what [docs-budgets.json](docs-budgets.json) names in its place — raising one is an edit of that file (R145 spec). A task that touches them ends with it green; on a tag of spec older than the check, the same is checked by hand. When the repository has parts with checks of their own, each part's checks are its rule, `.claude/rules/<part>.md`, with the part's files in its `paths`, and this section names each rule and its part in one line: Claude Code loads a rule only when the session reads or edits a file it matches, and CI runs every check on every pull request (R143 spec; measurements 1.5 spec). `docs-check-repo` checks the rules too.
